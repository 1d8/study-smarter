# Tips to study smarter


***

* The most learning during lectures occurs within the first 25 min. (average)

* Once you begin to feel as if you're slipping away, take a break. The break shouldn't be more than 10 min. Do something fun during your break.

* Having a dedicated study area will help condition yourself to get used to studying. 
> **NOTE:** that you can create environmental cues for yourself, for example: When you're at your desk in your bedroom, only study & do nothing else. This will condition yourself to study every time you study at your desk. Don't let anyone in your room, this will prevent it from being a place to socialize.

* When attempting to understand something, be sure you can explain it in your own words and/or attempting to teach someone else
